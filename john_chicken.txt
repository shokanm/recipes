1. Chef John's Chicken and Mushrooms
The trick to this super-simple recipe is to sear the chicken to a beautiful brown crust and cook the mushrooms until they give off their natural juices. With this technique, Chef John builds big flavor using just two main ingredients -- chicken and mushrooms -- plus salt and pepper, a little olive oil for saut√©ing, and a little butter to finish the dish.
